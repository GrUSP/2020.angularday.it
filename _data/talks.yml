  title: "Web Components for Authentication: The what, the why and the how"
  extract: > 
    In this talk, we will take a look at what Web Components are, what they consist of and how to build them.
    Then we will see what advantages Web Components have when approaching and implementing authentication into our application, 
    how Web Components can facilitate the implementation of authentication and share some examples of which Web Components 
    we can create to simplify the process. We will also talk about what options we have today to build Web Components, 
    which frameworks support them and whether browsers are ready for them.

  title: "Testing with MockStore in NgRx 8"
  extract: > 
    What's new in NgRx testing? Actually, a lot! The two most recent releases of NgRx have quietly introduced and iterated
    the @ngrx/store/testing module, giving developers easier ways to test store-dependent components and services. 
    In this session, I will demonstrate testing store-dependent components and services using the NgRx MockStore, 
    which provides the ability to mock the entire state or individual selectors. Say goodbye to the StoreModule!

  title: "I got 99 problems but accessibility ain't one"
  extract: > 
    Accessibility has come up more and more in the last years.
    We hear here and there that we need to make things work for certain people and in many occasions we disregard it thinking that we don’t need it 
    or that it does not apply for our specific case. But the truth is that as developers, business people, designers, etc, 
    we have the responsibility to provide the best experience for our users no matter how they interact with the world.
    Accessibility is not only for a few, is not an extra, is something that we need to tackle in every step of the way. 
    There are many things we can do to ensure that we are not excluding people from using our products and to welcome everyone 
    in this big world called the web!

  title: "Sending the Angular app into deep, deep offline with Workbox	"
  extract: > 
    There is no need to advocate for progressive web apps anymore.
    The idea of connection-independent applications has proven its viability and we see more and more large and small projects following that path, making the offline-ready behavior a best practice, good manner of the web. In my session, based on the deep exploration of Service Worker API possibilities and gathered UX gotchas, we go through the history of the offline web, the importance of treating the network as an enhancement, current challenges (and their solutions) and proper tooling. We architect our offline-ready Angular app applying the best tech and UX practices adding the features one-by-one: app shell, caching resources and data, sync when online. 
    All in name of our users who demand the new level of the resilient web experience.

  title: "Boost your performance from the setup and up!	"
  extract: >  
    Performance is more than optimal loading times! In order to deliver a performant experience for developers and endusers alike,
    you need to start from the very architecture design and setup implementation. 
    Let's put together a performant setup by leveraging Angular CLI, budget tools, schematics and monorepo definitions, 
    in order to avoid code repetition, copy pasting, and other foul practices!
